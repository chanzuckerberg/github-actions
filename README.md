# github-actions
The purpose of this repo is to host a collection of re-usable actions for usage across CZI.
See the [official docs](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/reusing-workflows) for more information.

Each workflow will be released with a distinct tag following semver and conventional commits.


NOTE:

GitHub has an undocumented limitation with reusable Actions -- they must all live under `.github/workflows/`
